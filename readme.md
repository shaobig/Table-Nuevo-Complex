# Table Nuevo Complex

The Table Nuevo Complex or TNC is a multicomponent server application providing a set of instruments for the music analysis. The system propagates the idea of the evaluation of music as a way to discover, analyse and arrange the different sides of the music world; determine own favourite artists and their releases and expand the boundaries of the surrounding being. The functional objective was the lack of the functionality in terms of the used instruments.

## Basic tools

- A summary table containing all the albums;
- An album pool which stores a set of albums that have not been rated yet;
- An artist and an album browser. It displays all the basic information about either.

## Technologies
- Java 17. The record objects are the greatest thing on the whole Earth;
- Spring frameworks id est Spring Core, Spring Boot, Spring WEB MVC and Spring Data JPA;
- Hibernate as a one of the most popular JPA implementations;
- JUnit and Mockito. The more quality tests you provide the clearer the documentation becomes;
- Lombok for the optimisation purposes;
- All the project dependencies and libraries were assembled by Maven.

## Infrastructure features
- Supports the Docker containerization for the PostgreSQL database management system;
- The next goal is to integrate a virtual space for the whole system and hand over this responsibility to the Kubernetes cluster.
